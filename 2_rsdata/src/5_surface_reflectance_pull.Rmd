#Pull surface reflectance values associated with in situ samples.

This script takes the shouldered, filtered in situ water quality dataset pulled from the Water Quality Portal/LAGOS and extracts associated Landsat surface reflectance values from Google Earth Engine.  The pulled reflectance values are the median pixel value of pixels with 80% water occurence (according to Pekel) within 200m of the provided lat/long of the in situ sample identified in the water quality dataset.  The standard deviation of the water pixel reflectance is included to enable quality control filtering.

#Retrieve existing data to avoid duplicating reflectance pulls

Create a list of existing reflectance csv's to filter whats been pulled down from GEE already.
```{r Get Existing}
#Retrieve existing reflectance data to avoid duplicates
#Need to add a fix for if these have been partially downloaded and moved...?
filesDownR <- drive_ls("WQP_SR_MatchUps") %>% 
  select(name)

```

#Open a python bash script to interact with Google Earth Engine using the package reticulate.

*Reticulate uses the default python path for the local machine.  This python needs to be authorized with google earth engine and have the necessary packages installed. To change the Python called by reticulate, change the default located in your .Rprofile.  This is done here using the 'Sys.setenv()' command at the top of the chunk. For more information on Reticulate go to https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate* 

*To configure your own computer to work with GEE, create a file call 'lib/cfg/gee_config.yml' with one line that looks like:*



```{r reticulate_version}
reticulate_python <- yaml::yaml.load_file('lib/cfg/gee_config.yml')$RETICULATE_PYTHON
use_python(reticulate_python)
