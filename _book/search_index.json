[["index.html", "1 AquaMatch data harmonization process", " 1 AquaMatch data harmonization process This bookdown documents the harmonization process for data downloaded from the Water Quality Portal (WQP) used to build the AquaMatch dataset, a data product of AquaSat v2. The WQP is a data warehouse for water-related data measured or observed within the United States and US Territories managed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council (NWQMC). AquaMatch collates water quality measurements and observations with optical and thermal satellite data from lakeSR and riverSR. All data in this workflow are processed as parameter groups, a high-level grouping used in AquaMatch for specific water quality measures found in the WQP. This document first describes selections made while downloading WQP data using the {dataRetrieval} package (CITE). It then walks through how the chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Secchi disc depth, and total suspended solids (TSS) parameter groups are each prepared (“pre-harmonization”), and then filtered and harmonized. Note: for the purposes of this bookdown, many terms surrounded by backticks are column names from the dataset being referenced. Others are code snippets or data values. For those that are column names, a full list of definitions for columns present in the original WQP dataset can be found in Table 7 here. Data are contributed to the WQP by a wide range of data providers (organizationIdentifier and organizationFormalName) with varying sampling and analysis methods and multiple characteristicNames. characteristicNames are defined by the WQP as: The object, property, or substance which is evaluated or enumerated by either a direct field measurement, a direct field observation, or by laboratory analysis of material collected in the field. Parameter groups are comprised of data from multiple characteristicNames in the WQP. For example, chlorophyll-related characteristicNamesinclude “Chlorophyll a”, “Chlorophyll a, corrected for pheophytin”, “Chlorophyll b”, and “Chlorophyll c” among several others. Only a subset of these characteristicNames are included in our “chlorophyll a” parameter group. As mentioned previously, measurements and observations within the WQP for a given parameter group are often sampled and analyzed using a variety of methods. Some of these methods for sampling and analysis are directly interoperable and others are not. The processing steps described within this bookdown walk through how we harmonize the data for each parameter group while flagging or removing data that may not have enough information associated with it. The product of this is a database of WQP entries with interoperability and reliability in mind. The result of this harmonization procedure is two datasets per parameter group. The first is a harmonized dataset that includes all of the original WQP columns in addition to those introduced in this workflow. The second is the output of all harmonization steps, including aggregation to the median value where simultaneous records occur. We define simultaneous records as those measured on the same day by the same organizationIndentifier at the same location with the same harmonized depth criteria. We believe that most users will only use this aggregated dataset, but we provide the unaggregated version for those who would like to make different decisions at any point in the tiering, flagging, or aggregation steps. "],["technical-details.html", "2 Technical details", " 2 Technical details AquaSat v2 uses the {targets} workflow management R package (Landau, 2021) to reimagine the original AquaSat codebase. The framework for this workflow is based on code adapted from this USGS pipeline and has been further developed by members of the ROSSyndicate. Technical details on {targets} workflows are available in the {targets} User Manual. {targets} workflows are built upon lists of “targets”, which can be thought of as analytical steps written out in code. This workflow uses a targets list spread across multiple scripts in an effort to facilitate organization of the code. _targets.R serves as a main list of targets and references the other lists of targets, which are defined inside 3_harmonize.R and create_bookdown.R. Note that the downloading and harmonizing scripts for WQP data are spread across two GitHub repositories: AquaMatch_download_WQP and AquaMatch_harmonize_WQP, respectively.

In this chapter, we detail the general tiering, flagging, and quality control philosophy we apply across all parameter groups. 4.1 Handling NA values Columns related directly to the interoperability of data in the WQP, specifically field and lab methodology and depth-related columns, often contain many NAs in part due to inconsistent entry across data providers. A highly restrictive filtering of the WQP that requires completed data fields would result in very limited data, in part, due to the prevalence of these NA values. Therefore, we built this pipeline to resolve as many NAs as possible, but to also include NAs within an “inclusive” data tier if all columns of interest are not resolvable. Specifically, we retain NA values if removing those NA records would drop 10% or more of the available data. 4.2 Heterogenous data In addition to NA values, WQP entries can be heterogenous for reasons such as: Having a variety of analytical methods with different levels of precision and accuracy that are used to quantify the same parameter Having a variety of sampling methods used to acquire the same parameter with varying levels of interoperability Having a variety of names or descriptions that represent the same analytical or sampling method across different organizations Having information relevant to assessing data reliability or method choice spread across multiple columns Containing observations with sample collection methods and analytical methods that are incompatible Having data with differing levels of meta data In order to control for some of this variation and provide end-users with something more readily navigable we have incorporated several tiers and flagging systems into the AquaSat v2 dataset: Analytical method tiering: Tiers indicating the interoperability of data based on the analytical method used to acquire measurements Field flags: Flags indicating whether the sample collection method is consistent with the analytical method Depth flags: Flags indicating the type of water sampling depth measurement or completeness of the measurement 4.2.1 Analytical method tiering The ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName column from the WQP is the primary column we use for determining which analytical method tier each record falls within. Details on how each parameter’s methods were sorted into tiers can be found in its corresponding harmonization chapter. The primary purpose of our analytical method tiering is to determine the reliability and accuracy of each analytical method across data providers and throughout time for each parameter in the AquaSat v2 dataset. We developed the following categories, which are represented in the analytical_tier column of the final dataset: Tier 0: Restrictive. Data that are verifiably self-similar across organizations and time-periods and can be considered highly reliable and interoperable Tier 1: Narrowed. Data that we have good reason to believe are self-similar, but for which we can’t verify full interoperability across data providers Tier 2: Inclusive. Data that are assumed to be reliable and are harmonized to our best ability given the information available from the data provider. This tier includes NA or non-resolvable descriptions for the analytical method, which often make up the majority of method descriptions for any given parameter. Because this tier represents many analytical methods, direct interoperability between samples is not guaranteed. 4.2.2 Field flags The field_flag column is used to check if the sample collection method (SampleCollectionMethod.MethodName) is reasonable (flag = 0), suspect (flag = 1), or inconclusive (flag = 2). “Reasonable” flags mean that the sample collection method and the analytical method or tier are in harmony with one another. “Suspect” flags are assigned when the sample collection method description isn’t consistent with what would be expected given the characteristicName and the ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName for a given record. “Inconclusive” or unknown flags are assigned to records with “inclusive” analytical tiers because these tiers include values such as NA, where it’s typically impossible to determine the appropriateness of a collection method for the sample record. The relationship between field flags and analytical tiers will vary by parameter; thus, each harmonization chapter contains specific information for these different cases. 4.2.3 Depth flags There are four columns that explicitly contain depth information for a given WQP entry, all of which contain a variety of measurement units. Below is a list of the four columns and their definitions according to the {dataRetrieval} package documentation. ActivityDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue: “A measurement of the vertical location (measured from a reference point) at which an activity occurred.” ResultDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue: “A measurement of the vertical location (measured from a reference point) at which a result occurred.” Only in STORET ActivityTopDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue: “A measurement of the upper vertical location of a vertical location range (measured from a reference point) at which an activity occurred.” ActivityBottomDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue: “A measurement of the lower vertical location of a vertical location range (measured from a reference point) at which an activity occurred.” Each of the above columns has a corresponding column containing the the associated unit used in measuring the item: ActivityDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureUnitCode ResultDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureUnitCode ActivityTopDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureUnitCode ActivityBottomDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureUnitCode 4.2.3.1 Pre-processing Prior to assigning the depth_flag we complete a few pre-processing steps: Convert the following character values to an explicit NA: “NA”, “999”, “-999”, “9999”, “-9999”, “-99”, “99”, “NaN” Convert depths in all four columns to meters from the depth unit listed by the data provider Create a single “discrete” sample depth column using a combination of the ActivityDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue and ResultDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue columns. We use ActivityDepth value when ResultDepth value is missing, and ResultDepth when ActivityDepth is missing. If both columns have values but disagree we use an average of the two. This pre-processing results in three “harmonized” columns reporting water sampling depth values in meters: harmonized_discrete_depth_value, harmonized_top_depth_value, harmonized_bottom_depth_value. Sample depth flags are assigned using the harmonized depth columns that result from the pre-processing steps above. If the record has no depth listed it is assigned a depth_flag of 0. A record with only discrete depth listed in the harmonized_discrete_depth_value is given a depth_flag of 1. A record with top and/or bottom depth (harmonized_top_depth_value, harmonized_bottom_depth_value), indicating an integrated sample, is assigned a depth_flag of 2, and any combination of discrete + top and/or bottom depths is assigned a depth_flag of 3, since the sample depth(s) can not be reconciled with certainty. 4.2.4 General note Generally speaking, we avoid further classification for any WQP entry’s parameter methodology, tier, or flag unless there are at least 1% of observations with the same unresolved text. 4.3 Simultaneous records The WQP contains records that can be considered true duplicates and others where multiple non-identical measurements are recorded at the same time, place, and depth by the same organization. We deal with these within each parameter’s harmonization step by taking the median value from simultaneous observations. We also report the standard deviation and the total number of entries contributing to the median in the harmonized_value_sd and harmonized_row_count columns of the final dataset. This record aggregation is dealt with separately for each parameter so that specific accommodations can be made based on their tiering and value cleaning processes. Additionally, this step also requires us to group the dataset by a subset of its original columns, necessarily resulting in a reduced subset of columns in the final data product. To aid in back-joining for advanced AquaSat users, we provide a subgroup_id column identifying the grouping used to create the aggregated median and standard deviation values. The subgroup_id is also present in an upstream, pre-aggregated dataset version that contains all records prior to aggregation and the original WQP columns along with the columns created in the harmonization steps. The upstream, pre-aggregated dadtaset is the p3_chla_preagg_grouped pipeline target. "],["chlorophyll-a-chla-harmonization-process.html", "5 Chlorophyll a (chla) harmonization process 5.1 Pre-harmonization of the raw chlorophyll WQP dataset 5.2 Harmonization-ready chlorophyll dataset", " 5 Chlorophyll a (chla) harmonization process Following the completion of the {dataRetrieval} download process described previously, the pipeline contains raw WQP data for each parameter of interest. Before we harmonize each parameter we run through a series of universal “pre-harmonization” steps, which ensure that the datasets are appropriately formatted when entering their harmonization routines. The text below first walks through the pre-harmonization steps for the raw chlorophyll a dataset and then delves into the specifics of the harmonization process. 5.1 Pre-harmonization of the raw chlorophyll WQP dataset At the start of the pre-harmonization process the raw chlorophyll WQP dataset contains 4.55 million rows. 5.1.1 Missing results Next, records that have missing data are dropped from the dataset. Several criteria are used when checking for missing data. If any of the below criteria are met the row is flagged as missing: Both the result column and detection limit column had NA data Result, result unit, activity comment, laboratory comment, and result comment columns are all NA The result comment column contains any user-provided text indicating a missing value, currently including: analysis lost, not analyzed, not recorded, not collected, or no measurement taken 82.12 thousand rows are dropped, resulting in a final count of 4.46 million. 5.1.2 Filter status The final step in pre-harmonization is to filter the ResultStatusIdentifier column to include only the following statuses: \"Accepted\" \"Final\" \"Historical\" \"Validated\" \"Preliminary\" NA These statuses generally indicate a reliable result having been reached, however we also include NA in an effort to be conservative. More specifically, when making decisions for this and other columns we occasionally retain NA values if removing the records would otherwise drop 10% or more of the available data. This step removes 73.35 thousand rows of data, leaving it with 4.39 million rows remaining. 5.2 Harmonization-ready chlorophyll dataset Once ready for harmonization, the chlorophyll a-only WQP dataset contains the following user-defined characteristicNames: Chlorophyll a, Chlorophyll a (probe relative fluorescence), Chlorophyll a, corrected for pheophytin, Chlorophyll a (probe), Chlorophyll a, free of pheophytin, Chlorophyll a, uncorrected for pheophytin, Chlorophyll a - Phytoplankton (suspended). These names are chosen in order to select for only those measurements that pertain to chlorophyll a. 5.2.1 Filter for water media We next ensure that the media type for all chlorophyll data is \"Surface Water\", \"Water\", \"Estuary\", or NA. 2855 rows are removed. The final row count after this is 4.39 million. 5.2.2 Document and remove fails In this step we filter out records based on indications that they have failed data quality assurance or quality control for some reason given by the data provider (these instances are referred to here as “failures”). After reviewing the contents of the ActivityCommentText, ResultLaboratoryCommentText, ResultCommentText, and ResultMeasureValue_original columns, we developed a list of terms that captured the majority of instances where records had failures or unacceptable measurements. We found the phrasing to be consistent across columns and so we searched for the same (case agnostic) terms in all four locations. The terms are: “beyond accept”, “cancelled”, “contaminat”, “error”, “fail”, “improper”, “instrument down”, “interference”, “invalid”, “no result”, “no test”, “not accept”, “outside of accept”, “problem”, “QC EXCEEDED”, “questionable”, “suspect”, “unable”, “violation”, “reject”, “no data”. Below are pie charts that break down the number of failure detections by column. Note that the plotting below is automated so if one or more of the columns listed above are not plotted, this indicates that the column(s) did not return any matches for the failure phrases. Also note that a single record can contain multiple failure phrases; therefore, failure phrases are not mutually exclusive. 5.2.2.1 ActivityCommentText fail detects 5.2.2.2 ResultCommentText fail detects 5.2.2.3 ResultLaboratoryCommentText fail detects 84.22 thousand rows are removed after detecting failure-related phrases and 4.3 million rows remain. 5.2.3 Clean MDLs In this step method detection limits (MDLs) are used to clean up the reported values. When a numeric value is missing for the data record (i.e., NA or text that became NA during an as.numeric call) we check for non-detect language in the ResultLaboratoryCommentText, ResultCommentText, ResultDetectionConditionText, and ResultMeasureValue columns. This language can be \"non-detect\", \"not detect\", \"non detect\", \"undetect\", or \"below\". If non-detect language exists then we use the DetectionQuantitationLimitMeasure.MeasureValue column for the MDL, otherwise if there is a &lt; and a number in the ResultMeasureValue column we use that number instead. We then use a random number between 0 and 0.5 * MDL as the record’s value moving forward. Once the process is complete we filter out any negative values in the dataset. We produce a new column, mdl_flag, from the MDL cleaning process. Records where no MDL-based adjustment was made and which are at or above the MDL are assigned a 0. Records with corrected values based on the MDL method are assigned a 1. Finally, records where no MDL-based adjustment was made and which contain a numeric value below the provided MDL are assigned a 2. Most of this step should not result in a change in rows, but we do drop records with negative measurement values. This results in 7766 rows being removed. The final row count after this is 4.3 million. 5.2.4 Clean approximate values Cleaning approximate values involves a similar process as for MDL cleaning. We flag “approximated” values in the dataset. The ResultMeasureValue column gets checked for all three of the following conditions: Numeric-only version of the column is still NA after MDL cleaning The original column text contained a number Any of ResultLaboratoryCommentText, ResultCommentText, or ResultDetectionConditionText match this regular expression, ignoring case: \"result approx|RESULT IS APPROX|value approx\" We then use the approximate value as the record’s value moving forward. Records with corrected values based on the above method are noted with a 1 in the approx_flag column. This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows are removed. The final row count after this is 4.3 million. 5.2.5 Clean values with “greater than” data The next step is similar to the MDL and approximate value cleaning processes, and follows the approximate cleaning process most closely. The goal is to clean up values that were entered as “greater than” some value. The ResultMeasureValue column gets checked for all three of the following conditions: Numeric-only version of the column is still NA after MDL &amp; approximate cleaning The original column text contained a number The original column text contained a &gt; We then use the “greater than” value (without &gt;) as the record’s value moving forward. Records with corrected values based on the above method are noted with a 1 in the greater_flag column. This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows are removed. The final row count after this is 4.3 million. 5.2.6 Drop unresolved NA measurements The goal of the preceding three steps was to prevent records with seemingly missing measurement data from being dropped if there was still a chance of recovering a usable value. At this point we’ve finished with that process and we proceed to check for remaining records with NA values in their harmonized_value column. If they exist, they are dropped. 0 rows are removed. The final row count after this is 4.3 million. 5.2.7 Harmonize record units The next step in chla harmonization is converting the units of WQP records. We create the following conversion table, which is used to translate units provided in WQP into micrograms per liter (ug/L): ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode conversion mg/l 1e+03 mg/L 1e+03 ppm 1e+03 ug/l 1e+00 ug/L 1e+00 mg/m3 1e+00 ppb 1e+00 mg/cm3 1e+06 ug/ml 1e+03 mg/ml 1e+06 ppt 1e+06 ug/mL 1e+03 mg/mL 1e+06 Below is a pie chart that breaks down the different unit codes that were dropped in the unit harmonization process, and how many records were lost with each code. Additionally we provide a set of histograms of harmonized measurements by CharacteristicName: 196.94 thousand rows are removed. The final row count after this is 4.1 million. 5.2.8 Clean depth data The next harmonization step cleans the four depth-related columns obtained from the WQP. The details behind this step are covered in the Depth flags section of the Tiering, flagging, and quality control philosophy chapter. This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows are removed. The final row count after this is 4.1 million. 5.2.9 Filter and tier analytical methods We next review the analytical methods used in measuring chlorophyll a, primarily by classifying the text provided with each record in ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName. Once these methods are classified we arrange them into hierarchical tiers as described in the Analytical method tiering section of the Tiering, flagging, and quality control philosophy chapter. However, prior to classification we check the ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName column for names that indicate non-chlorophyll a measurements. Phrases used to flag and remove unrelated methods from chlorophyll a data are: “sulfate”, “sediment”, “5310”, “counting”, “plasma”, “turbidity”, “coliform”, “carbon”, “2540”, “conductance”, “nitrate”, “nitrite”, “nitrogen”, “alkalin”, “zooplankton”, “phosphorus”, “periphyton”, “peri”, “biomass”, “temperature”, “elemental analyzer”, “2320”. This process drops 66.9 thousand rows leaving 4.03 million remaining. The next step towards creating analytical tiers is to then classify the methods in ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName into either: HPLC methods, spectrophotometer and fluorometer methods, or methods for which a pheophytin correction is recorded as part of the methodology. These classifications are not the final tiers, but they inform the tiering in the final step of this process. The criteria for each of the above classifications are: HPLC: Detection of “447”, “chromatography”, or “hplc” in the ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName or presence of 70951 or 70953 in the USGSPCode column Spectro/fluoro: Detection of “445”, “fluor”, “Welshmeyer”, “fld”, “10200”, “446”, “trichromatic”, “spectrophoto”, “monochrom”, “monchrom”, or “spec” not as part of a word in ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName Pheophytin correction: Detection of “correct”, “445”, “446”, or “in presence” in ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName or detection of “corrected for pheophytin” or “free of pheophytin” in CharacteristicName Finally, we group the data into three tiers as described in Tiering, flagging, and quality control philosophy. These tiers are: Tier Name Description Chl a details 0 Restrictive Data that are verifiably self-similar across organizations and time-periods and can be considered highly reliable and interoperable Includes records using HPLC methods 1 Narrowed Data that we have good reason to believe are self-similar, but for which we can’t verify full interoperability across data providers Spectrophotometer and fluorometer methods that are also pheophytin-corrected OR records where USGSPCode is 32209 2 Inclusive Data that are assumed to be reliable and are harmonized to our best ability given the information available from the data provider. This tier includes NA or non-resolvable descriptions for the analytical method, which often make up the majority of methods descriptions for any given parameter All other records by default, including NA methods and in situ probes At this point we export a file (3_harmonize/out/chla_analytical_tiering_record.csv) that contains a record of how specific method text was tiered and how many row counts corresponded to each method. 5.2.10 Flag based on field methods Next we flag field sampling methods based primarily on the SampleCollectionMethod.MethodName column. We first classify each record into either in vitro or in situ methods (i.e., in vitro assumes a water sample was collected and taken to a lab for analysis; in situ assumes a measurement was obtained in the field). We used the following strings to mark in vitro samples: “grab”, “bottle”, “vessel”, “bucket”, “jar”, “composite”, “integrate”, “UHL001”, “surface”, “filter”, “filtrat”, “1060B”, “kemmerer”, “collect”, “rosette”, “equal width”, “vertical”, “van dorn”, “bail”, “sample”, “sampling”, “lab” not in the middle of another word, or a “G” on its own as shorthand for “grab”. In situ samples were detected using “in situ”, “probe”, or “ctd”. Lastly we created the field flag based on whether the sampling method used agrees with the analytical method. Flags of 0 indicated that the field sampling method is in agreement with the analytical method, 1 indicates that the field sampling methods are uncharacteristic of the analytical method, and anything with analytical tier of 2 is given a field flag of 2 due to the ambiguity associated with those observations’ analytical methods and corresponding sampling methods. The following rules are used for chlorophyll a field sampling flags: Flag 0: Restrictive and narrowed analytical tiers with in vitro field methods Flag 1: Restrictive and narrowed analytical tiers with in situ field methods Flag 2: Any entry in the inclusive tier No records should be removed by this process and so there are 0 rows dropped leaving 4.03 million remaining in the harmonized chlorophyll a dataset. 5.2.11 Aggregate simultaneous records The final step of chlorophyll a harmonization is to aggregate simultaneous observations. Any group of samples determined to be simultaneous are simplified into a single record containing the median and standard deviation of the group. These can be either true duplicate records or records with non-identical values recorded at the same time and place and by the same organization. We identify simultaneous records to aggregate by creating identical subgroups (subgroup_id) from the following columns: parameter, OrganizationIdentifier, MonitoringLocationIdentifier, ActivityStartDateTime, harmonized_top_depth_value, harmonized_top_depth_unit, harmonized_bottom_depth_value, harmonized_bottom_depth_unit, harmonized_discrete_depth_value, harmonized_discrete_depth_unit, depth_flag, mdl_flag, approx_flag, greater_flag, analytical_tier, field_flag, harmonized_units. This selection limits the columns included in the final dataset, but we also provide a copy of the AquaMatch dataset prior to its aggregation (pipeline target p3_chla_preagg_grouped), and including the subgroup_id column, so that users can use the disaggregated data as well and match make joins between dataset versions. The final, aggregated values are presented in the harmonized_value and harmonized_value_sd columns. The number of rows used per group is recorded in the harmonized_row_count column. 1.12 million rows dropped leaving 2.91 million remaining in the final harmonized and aggregated chlorophyll a dataset. 5.2.12 Harmonized chlorophyll a At this point the harmonization of the chlorophyll a data from the WQP is complete and we export the final dataset for use later in the workflow. Below is a final set of histograms showing the distribution of harmonized measurements broken down by analytical_tier after aggregating simultaneous records. "],["doc-harmonization-process.html", "6 DOC harmonization process 6.1 Pre-harmonization of the raw doc WQP dataset 6.2 Harmonization-ready DOC dataset", " 6 DOC harmonization process Following the completion of the {dataRetrieval} download process described previously, the pipeline contains raw WQP data for each parameter of interest. Before we harmonize each parameter we run through a series of universal “pre-harmonization” steps, which ensure that the datasets are appropriately formatted when entering their harmonization routines. The text below first walks through the pre-harmonization steps for the raw DOC dataset and then delves into the specifics of the harmonization process. 6.1 Pre-harmonization of the raw doc WQP dataset At the start of the pre-harmonization process the raw DOC WQP dataset contains 2.7 million rows. 6.1.1 Missing results Next, records that have missing data are dropped from the dataset. Several criteria are used when checking for missing data. If any of the below criteria are met the row is flagged as missing: Both the result column and detection limit column had NA data Result, result unit, activity comment, laboratory comment, and result comment columns are all NA The result comment column contains any user-provided text indicating a missing value, currently including: analysis lost, not analyzed, not recorded, not collected, or no measurement taken 100.11 thousand rows are dropped, resulting in a final count of 2.6 million. 6.1.2 Filter status The final step in pre-harmonization is to filter the ResultStatusIdentifier column to include only the following statuses: \"Accepted\" \"Final\" \"Historical\" \"Validated\" \"Preliminary\" NA These statuses generally indicate a reliable result having been reached, however we also include NA in an effort to be conservative. More specifically, when making decisions for this and other columns we occasionally retain NA values if removing the records would otherwise drop 10% or more of the available data. This step removes 1.88 thousand rows of data, leaving it with 2.6 million rows remaining. 6.2 Harmonization-ready DOC dataset Once ready for harmonization, the DOC WQP dataset contains the following user-defined characteristicNames: Organic carbon, Total carbon. 6.2.1 Filter media and fractions We next ensure that the media type for all DOC data is \"Surface Water\", \"Water\", \"Estuary\", or NA. Additionally at this step we select a subset of CharacteristicName and ResultSampleFractionText combinations that are relevant to DOC. These are: CharacteristicName ResultSampleFractionText “Organic carbon” “Dissolved” “Organic carbon” “Filtered, lab” “Organic carbon” “Filtered, field” “Organic carbon” “Filterable” “Total carbon” “Filterable” “Organic carbon” “Total” “Total carbon” NA “Total carbon” “Total” “Total carbon” “Organic” “Organic carbon” “Organic” 300.19 thousand rows are removed. The final row count after this is 2.3 million. 6.2.2 Document and remove fails In this step we filter out records based on indications that they have failed data quality assurance or quality control for some reason given by the data provider (these instances are referred to here as “failures”). After reviewing the contents of the ActivityCommentText, ResultLaboratoryCommentText, ResultCommentText, ResultDetectionConditionText, and ResultMeasureValue_original columns, we developed a list of terms that captured the majority of instances where records had failures or unacceptable measurements. We found the phrasing to be consistent across columns and so we searched for the same (case agnostic) terms in all four locations. The terms are: “beyond accept”, “cancelled”, “contaminat”, “error”, “fail”, “improper”, “instrument down”, “interference”, “invalid”, “no result”, “no test”, “not accept”, “outside of accept”, “problem”, “QC EXCEEDED”, “questionable”, “suspect”, “unable”, “violation”, “reject”, “no data”, “time exceed”. Below are pie charts that break down the number of failure detections by column. Note that the plotting below is automated so if one or more of the columns listed above are not plotted, this indicates that the column(s) did not return any matches for the failure phrases. Also note that a single record can contain multiple failure phrases; therefore, failure phrases are not mutually exclusive. 6.2.2.1 ActivityCommentText fail detects 6.2.2.2 ResultCommentText fail detects 6.2.2.3 ResultLaboratoryCommentText fail detects 24.9 thousand rows are removed after detecting failure-related phrases and 2.28 million rows remain. 6.2.3 Clean MDLs In this step method detection limits (MDLs) are used to clean up the reported values. When a numeric value is missing for the data record (i.e., NA or text that became NA during an as.numeric call) we check for non-detect language in the ResultLaboratoryCommentText, ResultCommentText, ResultDetectionConditionText, and ResultMeasureValue columns. This language can be \"non-detect\", \"not detect\", \"non detect\", \"undetect\", or \"below\". If non-detect language exists then we use the DetectionQuantitationLimitMeasure.MeasureValue column for the MDL, otherwise if there is a &lt; and a number in the ResultMeasureValue column we use that number instead. We then use a random number between 0 and 0.5 * MDL as the record’s value moving forward. Once the process is complete we filter out any negative values in the dataset. We produce a new column, mdl_flag, from the MDL cleaning process. Records where no MDL-based adjustment was made and which are at or above the MDL are assigned a 0. Records with corrected values based on the MDL method are assigned a 1. Finally, records where no MDL-based adjustment was made and which contain a numeric value below the provided MDL are assigned a 2. Most of this step should not result in a change in rows, but we do drop records with negative measurement values. This results in 3211 rows being removed. The final row count after this is 2.27 million. 6.2.4 Clean approximate values Cleaning approximate values involves a similar process as for MDL cleaning. We flag “approximated” values in the dataset. The ResultMeasureValue column gets checked for all three of the following conditions: Numeric-only version of the column is still NA after MDL cleaning The original column text contained a number Any of ResultLaboratoryCommentText, ResultCommentText, or ResultDetectionConditionText match this regular expression, ignoring case: \"result approx|RESULT IS APPROX|value approx\" We then use the approximate value as the record’s value moving forward. Records with corrected values based on the above method are noted with a 1 in the approx_flag column. This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows are removed. The final row count after this is 2.27 million. 6.2.5 Clean values with “greater than” data The next step is similar to the MDL and approximate value cleaning processes, and follows the approximate cleaning process most closely. The goal is to clean up values that were entered as “greater than” some value. The ResultMeasureValue column gets checked for all three of the following conditions: Numeric-only version of the column is still NA after MDL &amp; approximate cleaning The original column text contained a number The original column text contained a &gt; We then use the “greater than” value (without &gt;) as the record’s value moving forward. Records with corrected values based on the above method are noted with a 1 in the greater_flag column. This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows are removed. The final row count after this is 2.27 million. 6.2.6 Drop unresolved NA measurements The goal of the preceding three steps was to prevent records with seemingly missing measurement data from being dropped if there was still a chance of recovering a usable value. At this point we’ve finished with that process and we proceed to check for remaining records with NA values in their harmonized_value column. If they exist, they are dropped. 0 rows are removed. The final row count after this is 2.27 million. 6.2.7 Harmonize record units The next step in doc harmonization is converting the units of WQP records. We create the following conversion table, which is used to translate units provided in WQP into mg per liter (mg/L): ResultMeasure.MeasureUnitCode conversion mg/L 1.000e+00 mg/l 1.000e+00 ppm 1.000e+00 ug/l 1.000e-03 ug/L 1.000e-03 mg/m3 1.000e-03 ppb 1.000e-03 mg/cm3 1.000e+03 ug/ml 1.000e+00 mg/ml 1.000e+03 ppt 0.000e+00 umol/L 6.008e-02 Below is a pie chart that breaks down the different unit codes that were dropped in the unit harmonization process, and how many records were lost with each code. Additionally we provide a set of histograms of harmonized measurements by CharacteristicName: 7.69 thousand rows are removed. The final row count after this is 2.27 million. 6.2.8 Clean depth data The next harmonization step cleans the four depth-related columns obtained from the WQP. The details behind this step are covered in the Depth flags section of the Tiering, flagging, and quality control philosophy chapter. This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows are removed. The final row count after this is 2.27 million. 6.2.9 Filter and tier analytical methods We next review the analytical methods used in measuring DOC, primarily by classifying the text provided with each record in ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName. Once these methods are classified we arrange them into hierarchical tiers as described in the Analytical method tiering section of the Tiering, flagging, and quality control philosophy chapter. However, prior to classification we check the ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName column for names that indicate non-DOC measurements. Phrases used to flag and remove unrelated methods from DOC data are: “Oxygen”, “Nitrogen”, “Ammonia”, “Metals”, “E. coli”, “Anion”, “Cation”, “Phosphorus”, “Silica”, “PH”, “HARDNESS”, “Nutrient”, “Turbidity”, “Nitrate”, “Conductance”, “Alkalinity”, “Chlorophyll”, “Solids”, “Temperature”, “Color in Water”, “Coliform”, “PARTICULATE CARBON (inorg+org)”, “5210”, “bed sed”, “bs, calc”, “5220”, “Suspended-Sediment in Water”. This process drops 84.77 thousand rows leaving 2.18 million remaining. The next step towards creating analytical tiers is to then classify the methods in ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName into either: Combustion + infrared methods, Persulfate-UV/Heated Persulfate Oxidation+IR detection methods, Wet Oxidation+Persulfate+IR methods, Elemental Analyzer methods, or Carbonaceous Analyzer methods. These classifications are not the final tiers, but they inform the tiering in the final step of this process. The criteria for each of the above classifications are: Combustion+IR: Detection of “5310 B”, “5310B”, “415.1”, “combustion” but only without “5310 C” or “5310C”, “0.45u silver, persulfate IR”, “0.7 um GFF, combust IR”, “Laboratory Procedures for Water Quality Chemical Analysis”, “CO2 formation”, “Qian &amp; Mopper 1996”, or “Shimadzu TOC Analyzer” in ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName Persulfate-UV/Heated Persulfate Oxidation+IR: Detection of “5310 C”, “5310C”, “persulfate oxid”, “415.2”, “Ultraviolet”, “Heated-Persulfate”, or “UV” in ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName Wet Oxidation+Persulfate+IR detection: Detection of “0.45 ?um cap”, “0.45um cap”, “wet oxidation”, “5310 D”, “5310D”, “415.3”, “O-3100 ~ Total Organic Carbon in Water” in ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName Elemental Analyzer: Detection of “440” in ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName Carbonaceous Analyzer: Detection of “9060 A” in ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName Finally, we group the data into three tiers as described in Tiering, flagging, and quality control philosophy. These tiers are: Tier Name Description DOC details 0 Restrictive Data that are verifiably self-similar across organizations and time-periods and can be considered highly reliable and interoperable Includes records using Wet Oxidation+Persulfate+IR or Persulfate-UV/Heated Persulfate Oxidation+IR methods 1 Narrowed Data that we have good reason to believe are self-similar, but for which we can’t verify full interoperability across data providers Includes records using combustion+IR or elemental analyzer methods 2 Inclusive Data that are assumed to be reliable and are harmonized to our best ability given the information available from the data provider. This tier includes NA or non-resolvable descriptions for the analytical method, which often make up the majority of methods descriptions for any given parameter Carbonaceous and all other records by default, including NA methods At this point we export a file (3_harmonize/out/doc_analytical_tiering_record.csv) that contains a record of how specific method text was tiered and how many row counts corresponded to each method. 6.2.10 Flag based on field methods DOC doesn’t have field sampling methods that lend themselves well to comparing with analytical methods and assigning flags, unlike variables like chlorophyll a. We fill the field_flag column with “not applicable” for DOC. No records should be removed by this process and so there are 0 rows dropped leaving 2.18 million remaining in the harmonized DOC dataset. 6.2.11 Aggregate simultaneous records The final step of DOC harmonization is to aggregate simultaneous observations. Any group of samples determined to be simultaneous are simplified into a single record containing the median and standard deviation of the group. These can be either true duplicate records or records with non-identical values recorded at the same time and place and by the same organization. We identify simultaneous records to aggregate by creating identical subgroups (subgroup_id) from the following columns: parameter, OrganizationIdentifier, MonitoringLocationIdentifier, ActivityStartDateTime, harmonized_top_depth_value, harmonized_top_depth_unit, harmonized_bottom_depth_value, harmonized_bottom_depth_unit, harmonized_discrete_depth_value, harmonized_discrete_depth_unit, depth_flag, mdl_flag, approx_flag, greater_flag, analytical_tier, field_flag, harmonized_units. This selection limits the columns included in the final dataset, but we also provide a copy of the AquaMatch dataset prior to its aggregation (pipeline target p3_doc_preagg_grouped), and including the subgroup_id column, so that users can use the disaggregated data as well and match make joins between dataset versions. The final, aggregated values are presented in the harmonized_value and harmonized_value_sd columns. The number of rows used per group is recorded in the harmonized_row_count column. 0.46 million rows dropped leaving 1.72 million remaining in the final harmonized and aggregated doc dataset. 6.2.12 Harmonized DOC At this point the harmonization of the DOC data from the WQP is complete and we export the final dataset for use later in the workflow. Below is a final set of histograms showing the distribution of harmonized measurements broken down by analytical_tier after aggregating simultaneous records.
