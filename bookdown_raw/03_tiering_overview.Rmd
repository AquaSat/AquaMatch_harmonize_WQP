# Data tiering overview

The WQP contains many columns, which also vary greatly in their level of completion record-by-record. In response to this we have developed a data tiering system in AquaMatch for quick filtering of methods by level of completion and method quality.

We have standardized the columns used in the data tiering process. The process, which is outlined below, provides the end user with two columns of tiering flags. These are `methods_tier` (relating to analytical method) and `field_tier` (relating to field collection method).

## Analytical methods tiers

Tier 1: Data are likely comparable across sites and times
Tier 2: Data are potentially comparable across sites and times
Tier 3: Data are unlikely to be comparable across sites and times

## Field tiers

Tier 1: Sample was filtered and has a depth measurement and units provided
Tier 2: Depth data is either absent or incomplete for the sample but the sample was filtered
Tier 3: Depth data is either absent or incomplete and the sample was not filtered
