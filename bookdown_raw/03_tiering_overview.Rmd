# Tiering, flagging, and quality control philosophy 

The variety of data providers, parameters, and methods in the WQP inevitably results in a heterogenous dataset that requires rigorous quality control before analytical use.

## Handling `NA` values
Columns related directly to the interoperability of data in the WQP, specifically field and lab methodology and depth-related columns, often contain many `NA`s in part due to inconsistent entry across data providers. A highly restrictive filtering of the WQP that requires completed data fields would result in very limited data, in part, due to the prevalence of these `NA` values. Therefore, we are building this dataset to resolve as many `NA`s as possible, but to also include `NA`s within an "inclusive" data tier if all columns of interest are not resolvable.

## Heterogenous data
In addition to `NA` values, WQP entries can be heterogenous for reasons such as:

+ Having a variety of analytical methods with different levels of precision and accuracy that can be used to quantify the same parameter
+ Having a variety of names or descriptions of the same (e.g., analytical) method across different organizations
+ Containing data for one parameter obtained by multiple sampling methods with varying levels of interoperability or necessary metadata
+ Having information relevant to assessing data reliability or method choice spread across multiple columns
- + Containing observations with sample collection methods and analytical methods that are incompatible
- + Having data with differing levels of meta data 
In order to control for some of this variation and provide end-users with something more readily navigable we have incorporated several tiers and flagging systems into the AquaSat v2 dataset:

+ **Analytical method tiering**: Tiers indicating the interoperability of data based on the analytical method used to acquire measurements
+ **Field flags**: Flags indicating whether the sample collection method is consistent with the analytical method
+ **Depth flags**: Flags indicating the type of depth measurement or completeness of the depth measurement

### Analytical method tiering
The `ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName` column from the WQP is the primary column we use for determining which analytical method tier each record falls within. Details on how each parameter's methods were sorted into tiers can be found in its corresponding harmonization chapter.

The primary purpose of our analytical method tiering is to determine the reliability and accuracy of each analytical method across data providers and throughout time for each parameter in the AquaSat v2 dataset. We developed the following categories for this column, which is denoted as `analytical_tier` in the final dataset: 

+ **Tier 0: Restrictive.** Data that are verifiably self-similar across organizations and time-periods and can be considered highly reliable and interoperable
+ **Tier 1: Narrowed.** Data that we have good reason to believe are self-similar, but for which we can’t verify full interoperability across data providers
+ **Tier 2: Inclusive.** Data that are assumed to be reliable and are harmonized to our best ability given the information available from the data provider. This tier includes `NA` or non-resolvable descriptions for the analytical method, which often make up the majority of methods descriptions for any given parameter. Because this tier represents many analytical methods, direct interoperability between samples is not guaranteed.

### Field flags
The `field_flag` column is used to check if the sample collection method (`SampleCollectionMethod.MethodName`) is reasonable (flag = 0), suspect (flag = 1), or inconclusive (flag = 2).  "Reasonable" flags mean that the sample collection method and the analytical method or tier are in harmony with one another. "Suspect" flags are assigned when the sample collection method description isn’t consistent with what would be expected given the `characteristicName` and the `ResultAnalyticalMethod.MethodName` for a given record. "Inconclusive" or unknown flags are assigned to records with "inclusive" analytical tiers because these tiers include values such as `NA`, where it's typically impossible to determine the appropriateness of a collection method for the sample record. The relationship between field flags and analytical tiers will vary by parameter and each harmonization chapter contains specific information for these different cases.

### Depth flags
There are four columns that explicitly contain depth information for a given WQP entry, all of which contain a variety of measurement units. Below is a list of the four columns and their definitions according to the [{dataRetrieval} package documentation](https://rconnect.usgs.gov/dataRetrieval/reference/readWQPqw.html).

1. `ActivityDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue`: "A measurement of the vertical location (measured from a reference point) at which an activity occurred."
2. `ResultDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue`: "A measurement of the vertical location (measured from a reference point) at which a result occurred." *Only in STORET*
3. `ActivityTopDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue`: "A measurement of the upper vertical location of a vertical location range (measured from a reference point) at which an activity occurred."
4. `ActivityBottomDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue`: "A measurement of the lower vertical location of a vertical location range (measured from a reference point) at which an activity occurred."

Each of the above columns has a corresponding column containing the ["code that represents the unit for measuring the item"](https://rconnect.usgs.gov/dataRetrieval/reference/readWQPqw.html):

1. `ActivityDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureUnitCode`
2. `ResultDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureUnitCode`
3. `ActivityTopDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureUnitCode`
4. `ActivityBottomDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureUnitCode`

#### Pre-processing
Prior to assigning the `depth_flag` we complete a few pre-processing steps:

1. Convert the following (character) values to an explicit `NA`: "NA", "999", "-999", "9999", "-9999", "-99", "99", "NaN"
2. Convert depths in all four columns to meters from the depth unit listed by the data provider
3. Create a single "discrete" sample depth column using a combination of the `ActivityDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue` and `ResultDepthHeightMeasure.MeasureValue` columns. We use `ActivityDepth` value when `ResultDepth` value is missing, and `ResultDepth` when `ActivityDepth` is missing. If both columns have values but disagree we use an average of the two. 

This pre-processing results in three "harmonized" columns reporting depth values in meters: `harmonized_discrete_depth_value`, `harmonized_top_depth_value`, `harmonized_bottom_depth_value`. 

Depth flags are assigned using the harmonized depth columns that result from the pre-processing steps above. If the record has no depth listed it is designated `depth_flag` = 0. A record with only discrete depth (listed in the `harmonized_discrete_depth_value` is given a `depth_flag` = 1. A record with top and/or bottom depth (`harmonized_top_depth_value`, `harmonized_bottom_depth_value`), indicating an integrated sample, is assigned `depth_flag` = 2, and any combination of discrete + top and/or bottom depths is assigned `depth_flag` = 3, where the sample depth(s) can not be reconciled with certainty. 

### General note
Generally speaking, we avoid further classification for any WQP entry's parameter methodology, tier, or flag unless there are at least 1% of observations with the same unresolved text.

## Simultaneous records
The WQP contains records that can be considered true duplicates and others where multiple non-identical measurements are recorded at the same time and place and by the same organization. We deal with these within each parameter's harmonization step by taking the median value from simultaneous observations.  

This is dealt with separately for each parameter so that specific accommodations can be made based on the tiering and value cleaning process for each parameter. For example, for chlorophyll *a*, this step includes filtering out any negative `harmonized_value`s prior to aggregation. Additionally, this step also requires us to group the dataset by a subset of its original columns in order to create aggregate groups, necessarily resulting in a reduced subset of columns in the final data product.
