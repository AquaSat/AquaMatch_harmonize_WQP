# Secchi harmonization process

### Initial dataset

After the pre-harmonization process the secchi-only WQP dataset contains
2.92 million rows.

### Filter for water media

The first step in secchi harmonization is to ensure that the media type
for the data is `"water"` or `"Water"`. This should just be a
precautionary step: 0 rows are removed. The row count after this is 2.92
million.

### Remove fails and other missing data

In this step we filter out records based on indications that they have
failed data for some reason. We screen the following columns:
`ActivityCommentText`, `ResultLaboratoryCommentText`,
`ResultCommentText`, and `ResultMeasureValue`. Examples of text that
results in a dropped record includes (but is not limited to): `"fail"`,
`"suspect"`, `"error"`, `"beyond accept"`, `"interference"`,
`"questionable"`, `"problem"`, `"violation"`, `"rejected"`,
`"no secchi"`. Specific target text varies by column.

24.93 thousand rows are removed and 2.89 million rows remain.

### Clean MDLs

In this step method detection limits (MDLs) are used to clean up the
reported values. When a numeric value is missing for the data record
(i.e., `NA` or text that became `NA` during an `as.numeric` call) we
check for non-detect language in the `ResultLaboratoryCommentText`,
`ResultCommentText`, `ResultDetectionConditionText`, and
`ResultMeasureValue` columns. This language can be `"non-detect"`,
`"not detect"`, `"non detect"`, `"undetect"`, or `"below"`.

If non-detect language exists then we use the
`DetectionQuantitationLimitMeasure.MeasureValue` column for the MDL,
otherwise if there is a `<` and a number in the `ResultMeasureValue`
column we use that number instead.

We then use a random number between 0 and `0.5 * MDL` as the record’s
value moving forward.

This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows
are removed. The row count after this is 2.89 million.

### Clean approximate values

Cleaning approximate values involves a similar process as for MDL
cleaning. We flag “approximated” values in the dataset. The
`ResultMeasureValue` column gets checked for **all** three of the
following conditions:

1.  Numeric-only version of the column is still `NA` after MDL cleaning
2.  The original column text contained a number
3.  Any of `ResultLaboratoryCommentText`, `ResultCommentText`, or
    `ResultDetectionConditionText` match this regular expression,
    ignoring case: `"result approx|RESULT IS APPROX|value approx"`

We then use the approximate value as the record’s value moving forward.

This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows
are removed. The row count after this is 2.89 million.

### Clean values with “greater than” data

The next step is similar to the MDL and approximate value cleaning
processes, and follows the approximate cleaning process most closely.
The goal is to clean up values that were entered as “greater than” some
value. The `ResultMeasureValue` column gets checked for **all** three of
the following conditions:

1.  Numeric-only version of the column is still `NA` after MDL &
    approximate cleaning
2.  The original column text contained a number
3.  The original column text contained a `>`

We then use the “greater than” value (without `>`) as the record’s value
moving forward.

This should not result in a change in rows but we still check: 0 rows
are removed. The row count after this is 2.89 million.

### Harmonize record units

The next step in secchi harmonization is working with the units of the
WQP records. These can vary widely. We create the following conversion
table, which is used to translate units provided in WQP into meters:

<table class=" lightable-paper table" style="font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<thead>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">

<td style="text-align:right;">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

We also limit values to less than 15m to ensure realistic data. 3447
rows are removed. The row count after this is 2.89 million.

### Filter based on analytical method

Our next step is to aggregate secchi analytical methods into groups and
then filter out methods that may have been erroneously added, were
unclear, or which don’t meet our needs. We accomplish this using an
external match table `csv` file that is joined to the dataset. Methods
that are coded `"unlikely"` to be accurate methods are dropped.

This process drops 2474 rows leaving 2.89 million remaining.

### Filter based on fraction type

The next step in our secchi harmonization is filtering based on the
`ResultSampleFractionText` column. We assign fractions into two
categories based on whether the fraction text makes sense or not and
then retain only those records that have a fraction with
`"Makes sense"`. Fractions included in this are `NA`, `"Total"`, `" "`,
`"None"`, `"Unfiltered"`, `"Field"`.

This process drops 95.93 thousand rows leaving 2.79 million remaining in
the dataset.

<br>

### Filter based on sample method

We next filter based on the sample method, or
`SampleCollectionMethod.MethodName` column. As with analytical methods,
we accomplish this using an external match table `csv` file that is
joined to the dataset. Methods that are coded `"unlikely"` to be
accurate methods are dropped.

This process drops 32.16 thousand rows leaving 2.76 million remaining.

### Filter based on collection equipment

Finally, we examine the collection equipment
(`SampleCollectionEquipmentName`) column to check for equipment that
indicates non-secchi measurements. Once again we use an external match
table `csv` file that is joined to the dataset. Equipment types that are
coded `"unlikely"` to be accurate to secchi are dropped.

This process drops 65.24 thousand rows leaving 2.69 million remaining.
