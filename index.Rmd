# AquaMatch harmonization process

This bookdown documents the harmonization process for raw parameter data downloaded from the Water Quality Portal (WQP) and used to build the AquaMatch dataset.

The data from the WQP includes a wide range of methods and characteristic names. For example, "chlorophyll" can be chlorophyll a, b, or both and retrieved using a variety of methods. We first get a better understanding of the type of data we have in order to know which methods and characteristic names to keep and use.
