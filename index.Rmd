# AquaMatch data harmonization process

This bookdown documents the harmonization process for raw data downloaded from the Water Quality Portal (WQP) and used to build the AquaMatch dataset.

The data from the WQP includes data obtained from a wide range of acquisition and analysis methods and multiple characteristic names are often of interest to a user studying a particular parameter. In this workflow, we create parameter groups to harmonize by (e.g., "chlorophyll a") in order to gain a better understanding of how to handle each parameter group. For example chlorophyll data in the WQP includes chlorophyll in any form (a, b, c, corrected for pheophytin, etc.) but only a subset of these will be of interest to us in building our "chlorophyll a" parameter group. Each of these parameters can be retrieved using a variety of methods, some of which are interoperable, and others which are not. This harmonization process allows us to filter out or flag data that may not have enough information for us to consider the value of high quality. 

This document first describes selections made while downloading WQP data, then describes the "pre-harmonization" process that data for all parameters go through, and then describes how the chlorophyll, DOC, secchi, and TSS parameters are each filtered and harmonized.
