# AquaMatch data harmonization process

This bookdown documents the harmonization process for raw data downloaded from the Water Quality Portal (WQP) and used to build the AquaMatch dataset.

The data from the Water Quality Portal (WQP) includes data obtained from a wide range of data providers with varying acquisition and analysis methods and multiple `characteristicNames`. In this workflow, we harmonize by parameter groups (e.g., "chlorophyll *a*"), which may include multiple `characteristicNames`. For example, chlorophyll-related `characteristicNames` include "Chlorophyll a", "Chlorophyll a, corrected for pheophytin", "Chlorophyll b", and "Chlorophyll c" among several others. Only a subset of these will be of interest to us in building our "chlorophyll *a*" parameter group. Each of the parameter groups can be sampled and analyzed using a variety of methods, some of which are directly interoperable, and others which are not. This harmonization process allows us to filter out or flag data that may not have enough information, creating a database of the WQP entries with varying degrees of direct interoperability. 

This document first describes selections made while downloading WQP data, the "pre-harmonization" process that data for all parameters go through, and then how the chlorophyll *a*, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Secchi disc depth, and total suspended solids (TSS) parameter groups are each filtered and harmonized.
